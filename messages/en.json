After the primary fermentation, it is optionally enriched with flavors such as fruits, herbs, or spices (several light years away) and canned. The result is a sparkling, mildly sour drink with a unique taste. (I’ve landed, fermented, and I’m ready to conquer Earth. Pssst, don’t tell NASA!)",
    "paragraph3": "Extensive experience in the brewing world and a desire to discover new, healthy beverages sent us on a mission to explore the universe of flavors. We returned with a tangy, healthy drink that beats even the worst hangover!"
