    "paragraph1": "A refreshing drink made from fermented green tea with a rich probiotic culture and a touch of juicy raspberry. Fermented and packed with good bacteria – for out-of-this-world immunity!",
    "paragraph2": "The tea is sweetened and fermented with SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast). After the primary fermentation, it is optionally enriched with flavors such as fruits, herbs, or spices (several light years away) and canned. The result is a sparkling, mildly sour drink with a unique taste. (I’ve landed, fermented, and I’m ready to conquer Earth. Pssst, don’t tell NASA!)",
    "paragraph3": "Extensive experience in the brewing world and a desire to discover new, healthy beverages sent us on a mission to explore the universe of flavors. We returned with a tangy, healthy drink that beats even the worst hangover!"
